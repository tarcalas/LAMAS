#I was thinking of representing the cards as numbers, with N%10 = 0 => A, N%10 = 1 => K, N%10 = 1 =>Q
#N/10 = 0 => Spades, N/10 = 1 => Hearts, N/10 = 2 => Diamonds, N/10 = 3 =>Clubs 
#So 0 = Ace of Spades, 31 = King of Clubs, etc.

#Also thinking about the different combinations as integers like 0 = 4 Aces, 1 = 4 Kings, etc.

#calculates the probability of winning from an agents perspective
def probabilityOfWinning(agentsCards, visibleCards, agentsBestHand):
  return probability

#deal cards
def dealCards(deck):
  return (agent0Cards, agent1Cards, restOfDeck)

#recursive approach is probably the best
def bestHand(agentsCards, visibleCards, pickedCards):
  return bestHandValue
